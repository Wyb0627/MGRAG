In all my years crossing the Jeff Davis overpass, which overlooks the Orleans Parish Prison, I don't think I've ever before noticed inmates in the yard. What's up with that? Did you know Louisiana incarcerates more adults per capita than any other state in the nation? And given that the US has the highest incarceration rate in the world, that means we lock up a lot of our people. If you'd have asked me last week, I would have said I suspected that Orleans Parish has the highest incarceration rate in the state. But I recently read it's St. Tammany parish, where the incarceration rate is approaching 1%. You can't really ignore the racial dimension of mass incarceration. According to Michelle Alexander, the United States &quot;imprisons a larger percentage of its black population than South Africa did at the height of apartheid.&quot;",

English: Oosterboschite, Trogtalite, Cuprosklodowskite, Quartz Locality: Musonoi Mine, Kolwezi, Kolwezi District, Katanga Copper Crescent, Katanga (Shaba), Democratic Republic of Congo (Za\u00efre) Size: 4.2 x 2.9 x 2.3 cm Oosterboschite and trogtalite are very rare selenides, with the former having palladium and copper and the latter having cobalt. The famed Musonoi is the Type Locality for Oosterboschite. This piece is from the Howard Belsky Collection, who collected many rare species. We believe the splendent gray crystals on one end surrounded by a green mineral are the oosterboschite. The quartz matrix holds several vugs richly lined with gemmy, green cuprosklowdoskite needles. The brown crystals richly lining one vug could be oxidized trogtalite, as MINDAT lists this species as being rose-violet. X-ray work would be needed to confirm species identifications in a normal case but, as this is from the Belsky Collection, it\u2019s pretty certain to be legitimate. He had his own analytical setup and did much work with friends in museums, specializing in rarities. Deutsch: Oosterboschit, Trogtalit, Cuprosklodowskit, Quarz Fundort: Musonoi Mine, Kolwezi, Kolwezi Distrikt, Katanga Kupfersichel, Katanga (Shaba), Demokratische Republik Kongo (Zaire) Gr\u00f6\u00dfe: 4,2 x 2,9 x 2,3 cm Oosterboschit und Trogtalit sind sehr seltene Selenide, wobei ersteres Palladium und Kupfer und letzteres Cobalt enth\u00e4lt. Die ber\u00fchmte Lagerst\u00e4tte Musonoi ist die Typlokalit\u00e4t f\u00fcr Oosterboschit. Dieses St\u00fcck stammt aus der Sammlung von Howard Belsky, der viele seltene Arten sammelte. Wir glauben, dass die grauen, von einem gr\u00fcnen Mineral umgebenen Kristalle an einem Ende aus Oosterboschit bestehen. Die Quarz-Matrix enth\u00e4lt gr\u00fcne Cuprosklowdoskit-Nadeln als Drusenf\u00fcllung. Eine weitere Drusenf\u00fcllung mit braunen Kristalle k\u00f6nnte aus oxidiertem Trogtalit bestehen. Bei Mindat wird diese Spezies als rosa-violett beschrieben. Im Normalfall w\u00e4re eine R\u00f6ntgenstrukturanalyse n\u00f6tig, um die Mineralarten dieser Probe zu best\u00e4tigen. Da diese jedoch aus der Belsky Sammlung stammt, sind die Angaben zur Probe vertrauensw\u00fcrdig. Belsky hatte seine eigene analytische Einrichtung und arbeitete zudem viel mit Freunden in Museen zusammen, die auf Rarit\u00e4ten spezialisiert waren.",

Originally this helmet would have been a gleaming golden color and decorated with red glass studs. The helmet is unlikely to have been used in battle and was probably a form of ceremonial headress. The helmet is a very rare find, it is the only Iron Age horned helmet to be found in Europe. The helmet is made from sheet bronze sections held together with bronze rivets. The raised decoration is repeated on the back and front of the helmet. The decoration on the helmet is similar to the Great Torc from Snettisham, on display in case 19 in this gallery.

Five orders of shafts support seven orders of moulded arches with zig zag, billet, beak heads, grotesques, crenellations and all manner of leaves, animals and motifs. Structurally unsound as the arch has sunk in the last 900 years to give a rather depressed appearance - nevertheless, one of the finest chancel arches in England and a wonder to behold.",
